In the morning, I make my room clean and then at noon I goto our company and sleep there.  
Beause the sleepy, I cannot fall into study. Just let the time flow away in the afternoon, so the a little sleep is very important for me to study. Something you can do anytime, and something you can do only one time, so make you best to do the thing that you just can do in the best time.  
  
## I do this thing because I can only do it in this time. I cannot do it in other time.
